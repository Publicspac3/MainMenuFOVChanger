# MainMenuFOVChanger
Bakkesmod plugin that changes the Menu FOV

A lot of the code is based off the following:

https://github.com/CinderBlocc/SettingsFileExamples

https://github.com/CrunchyRL/MainMenuBackgroundChanger

https://github.com/Martinii89/BakkesmodPluginTemplate

Normal FOV is just arbitrary.

You also might need to load the plugin, to do this, press f2 -> plugins -> plugin manager (beta) -> open plugin manager -> click the box next to "MainMenuFOVChanger"

All this really does is add a button and a slider; it's cosmetic and mainly for fun. (it's pretty useless)

im new to coding so a lot is probably garbage lol
